# 🛡️ MahaRakshak – Maharashtra’s Hyperlocal Health Shield
तुमचं आरोग्य, आमचं कर्तव्य!

🚀 *Designed for Maharashtra | Powered by the People*

---

## 📌 What is MahaRakshak?

**MahaRakshak** is a web-first COVID suspect tracker tailored for **Maharashtra**, built to empower citizens and assist health authorities through **community-driven reporting**, **hyperlocal data**, and **real-time mapping**.

It’s not just a tracker — it’s an **early warning system**, an **action dashboard**, and a **public safety tool**.

---

## 🔥 Why MahaRakshak Stands Out

- 🧭 **Hyperlocal**: Works at district and taluka levels — not just national stats.
- 👥 **Community-Powered**: People self-report symptoms; clusters form organically.
- 🌐 **Web-First**: No downloads. Works on any browser — even low-end devices.
- 🧩 **Modular & Scalable**: Easily extendable for vaccination alerts, AI, or telehealth.
- 💬 **Marathi-English UI**: Makes it accessible to all regions of Maharashtra.
- 🔒 **Privacy First**: No unnecessary data collection. Citizens stay in control.
